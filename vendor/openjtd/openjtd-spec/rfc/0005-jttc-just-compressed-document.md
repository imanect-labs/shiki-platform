# RFC 0005: JTTC JustCompressedDocument Container

Status: draft

Observed: 2026-06-18

Japanese translation: [0005-jttc-just-compressed-document.ja.md](0005-jttc-just-compressed-document.ja.md)

## Summary

Observed `.jttc` files are CFB containers whose document body is stored in `/JSCompDocument`.

That stream wraps another CFB document:

```text
outer CFB
  -> /JSCompDocument
  -> JustCompressedDocument marker
  -> LHA -lh5- member
  -> inner CFB
  -> /DocumentText
```

The current rjtd implementation decodes this observed profile directly, without adding a new LHA/LZH dependency.

## Relationship To rhwp Policy

rhwp has no LHA/LZH/LH5 dependency. Under the rjtd dependency policy, that means rjtd should not introduce one only for convenience.

The current support is therefore a narrow direct implementation for the observed `JustCompressedDocument` profile, matching the project rule: use rhwp dependencies where rhwp uses dependencies, and direct implementation where rhwp directly implements comparable low-level parsing.

## Outer CFB

Observed template samples expose a small outer stream inventory.

`setsuden_05.jttc`:

```text
stream      336  /\x04JSRV_SegmentInformation
stream     2294  /\x04JSRV_SummaryInformation
stream      416  /\x05SummaryInformation
stream   989412  /JSCompDocument
```

`rjtd info` reports the outer file as:

```text
format                       cfb-just-compressed-document
document_text_bytes          -
compressed_document_bytes    989412
```

The outer CFB does not expose `/DocumentText` directly.

## JSCompDocument Layout

Observed `/JSCompDocument` streams begin with:

```text
2600 4a75 7374 436f 6d70 7265 7373 6564 446f 6375 6d65 6e74
```

This is interpreted as a `JustCompressedDocument` marker. In the observed samples, an LHA member with method `-lh5-` starts at offset 38.

Observed member metadata:

| Sample | `/JSCompDocument` bytes | LHA method | packed bytes | original bytes |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `setsuden_05.jttc` | 989412 | `-lh5-` | 989292 | 1598976 |
| `setsuden_06.jttc` | 1182497 | `-lh5-` | 1182377 | 1913856 |

The decompressed bytes start with the CFB magic:

```text
d0 cf 11 e0 a1 b1 1a e1
```

## Inner CFB

The decompressed inner CFB contains `/DocumentText`. In the observed `setsuden_05.jttc` sample, the inner inventory contains 65 streams and `/DocumentText` is 564 bytes.

Current text extraction can read that inner `/DocumentText`, but the template samples are blank/control-heavy and produce no non-empty model blocks.

## Implemented Commands

```sh
cargo run -p rjtd-cli -- cat ../rjtd-testdata/local-samples/setsuden_05.jttc
cargo run -p rjtd-cli -- export ../rjtd-testdata/local-samples/setsuden_05.jttc --format json
```

The JSON export preserves the inner raw stream summary:

```json
{
  "blocks": [],
  "rawStreams": [
    { "name": "/DocumentText", "size": 564 }
  ]
}
```

## Known Gaps

- Only the observed single-member `-lh5-` profile is supported.
- LHA header checksums and CRC values are not validated yet.
- Other LHA methods are rejected.
- Multi-member archives are not interpreted.
- Inner CFB parsing uses the shared container reader, including the lenient FAT fallback.

## Next Steps

- Add regression fixtures for the minimal LH5 decoder using synthetic data.
- Preserve more `JSCompDocument` metadata in the document model once the metadata boundary is clearer.
- Continue interpreting the inner `DocumentText` stream instead of treating template/control-heavy content as blank text.
