# rjtd-model

Experimental document model and parser integration for Ichitaro JTD files.

`rjtd-model` is the model layer of
[OpenJTD](https://github.com/KimEJ/OpenJTD). It consumes the low-level evidence
produced by `rjtd-core` and provides the `Document`, `DocumentParser`, and
`DocumentCore` APIs used by exporters, the CLI, WebAssembly bindings, and the
OpenJTD viewer.

## Developer preview

Version 0.0.1 is an experimental developer preview. All public APIs may change
in any later 0.0.x release. The model deliberately exposes diagnostic and
evidence-preserving types while the JTD format is still being decoded.

## What it provides

- `parse_document` and `IchitaroParser` entry points.
- A document model for metadata, paragraphs, text runs, ruby annotations,
  unknown blocks, styles, objects, and preserved raw streams.
- `DocumentCore` APIs for document/page information, text-first SVG and HTML
  rendering, search/edit fallbacks, selection, and viewer integration.
- Candidate structures for observed layout, table, object, image, and style
  evidence.

Observed `.jtd` and `.jtt` documents are supported through the shared parser;
observed `.jttc` compressed documents are supported where their inner document
can be recovered. This is not complete coverage of all Ichitaro versions or
document features.

## Primary Rust API

- `parse_document(&[u8]) -> rjtd_core::Result<Document>` is the one-shot JTD
  family parsing entry point. It applies the default input limits before model
  construction.
- `Document` owns the parsed metadata, blocks, raw streams, and retained
  evidence. It is the value consumed by `rjtd-export`.
- `DocumentCore` is the application-facing facade used by the viewer and
  `rjtd-wasm`. Construct it with `DocumentCore::from_document` or
  `DocumentCore::from_bytes` when page information, rendering, navigation, or
  editing fallbacks are needed.
- `parse_document_with_limits` and `DocumentCore::from_bytes_with_limits` are
  the limits-aware alternatives when a caller must choose a non-default
  `ParseLimits` budget.

When optional style or font sources exceed a resource limit, their
`ResourceLimit` error is propagated rather than silently treating the source
as absent. Other retained optional evidence remains subject to the preview
interpretation boundaries below.

`DocumentCore::get_document_info()` returns JSON for applications rather than
a typed, versioned interchange format. Its `version` field is the
`rjtd-model` package version (0.0.1 here), not the source document's version
and not a schema version. The related `get_page_layer_tree()` output carries
its own `schema` object; neither JSON shape is a compatibility promise during
the 0.0.1 preview.

## Example

```rust,no_run
let bytes = std::fs::read("document.jtd")?;
let document = rjtd_model::parse_document(&bytes)?;
println!("{} blocks", document.blocks().len());
# let core = rjtd_model::DocumentCore::from_document(document);
# println!("{} pages", core.page_count());
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## Resource and interpretation limits

The default parser rejects source input larger than 64 MiB and inherits the
LH5 limits documented by `rjtd-core`. A `Candidate` is an observed-but-not-
confirmed interpretation, `Unknown` preserves unclassified source material,
and `Diagnostic` records why an interpretation is incomplete. JSON fields
carrying `decoded: false` are evidence boundaries: consume the retained bytes
or display the diagnostic, but do not promote the field to authoritative
layout or document meaning. Advanced layout, tables, embedded objects, styles,
and editing APIs can return conservative fallback results. The 0.0.1 model is
not a lossless round-trip editing contract.
